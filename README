HBnB is a command-line AirBnB clone that leverages a Python object as its storage engine. The Python object efficiently stores and retrieves property listings and user information. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and managing properties, ensuring data integrity and persistence within the terminal environment.

The capabilities of this command interpreter include:

- Generating a fresh instance, such as a new User or a new Place.
- Fetching an instance from a file, a database, or similar sources.
- Performing actions on instances, such as counting or calculating statistics.
- Modifying the attributes of an instance.
- Removing an instance from existence.

How to use:

- quit: Terminates the console.
- create: Generates a new instance of the BaseModel, saves it to a JSON file, and displays its unique identifier.
- destroy: Removes an instance based on the class name and identifier, updating the changes in the JSON file.
- show: Prints the textual representation of an instance, identified by its class name and identifier.
- all: Prints the textual representations of all instances, either based on a specific class name or regardless of the class.
- update: Modifies an instance, identified by its class name and identifier, by adding or updating attribute(s), and saves the changes to the JSON file.
